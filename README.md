### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to my GitHub!

Life is made up of goals and metrics. Passionate about **data science** and **technology**.

## :speech_balloon: A little about myself:
* :mortar_board: I am finishing the **Chemical Engineering** course, so you will probably see some projects involving applications in this area.
* :bulb: I started to become interested in this area of Data Science in January 2021, and since then I have been constantly developing my technical skills.
* :house_with_garden: I am Brazilian.
* :laughing: I am a very curious person, so I like to learn about many things.
* :soccer: :books:  My favorite hobbies are playing football, hiking and reading. (I also love to see memes involving data science - I learn even in those hours)

## :bookmark_tabs: Interests:
* Project themes (financial market and public policies)
* Python
* Machine Learning
* SQL
* Artificial intelligence
